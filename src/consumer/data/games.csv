Originally titled PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, the game has been offering players the full battle royale experience in a more realistic setting since 2017. Test yourself against 99 other players on seven different maps using whatever weapons you can find. Just be sure to be the last one standing, because that’s the only way to win.

Go it alone or play with friends in groups of two or four. Start out with only the clothes on your back, loot buildings, towns, and other locations to obtain the equipment you need. This includes weapons, armor, vehicles, and more. If you want the really good gear – and it’s likely you do – you’ll have to take some risks and head to the more dangerous zones on the map.

As is generally the case with the battle royale formula, PUBG’s map shrinks over time, herding all players into a random location where they will eventually have no choice but to engage each other or risk taking damage outside the restricted area. At the same time, random areas of the map will be bombed. So, players must be aware of both events and do their best to avoid them.

PUBG Battlegrounds is free-to-play and offers players purchasable items in the form of cosmetics. These do not impact game play.

2,World of Tanks,https://www.freetogame.com/g/2/thumbnail.jpg,Live,"If you like blowing up tanks, with a quick and intense game style you will love this game!","World of Tanks is a popular free to play multiplayer role playing team-based shooter game developed by Wargaming.net. World of Tanks is based around the middle of the 20th century, and features huge epic battles with various different game modes such as Standard, Assault, Encounter Battles, and an added bonus of 15 tanks vs 15 enemy tanks gameplay.

The game starts off with quite easy gameplay but eventuates into a more difficult game as you progress, and because a typical game only takes between 5-10 minutes the game can get quite intense as well. Unlike other games in World of Tanks you cannot respawn; so when your tank gets destroyed you tank gets destroy and you have to start a new game before you can play again. You can still watch the battlefield from a spectator but who wants to be a spectator when you can join in with action with a simple click of a button?

A different aspect of World of Tanks is that you wait in a queue called a “lobby” and then are launched into a random map, with random enemy players. In World of Tanks depending on your gaming style you start off with a fast lightly armored tank, a middle of the range type of tank, or a slower, more heavily armored tank. The tanks are based on real authentic tanks that were in World War 2. There are approximately 150 tanks from 3 different countries, these being Germany, Russia, and the United States of America.

The tank you choose can be customized by performing various different upgrades, which you can acquire through winning experience and credits you gain by winning battles against other enemy tanks. There are 10 different tiers, with tier 1 being a very weak tank going all the way up to tier 10 tanks which are the most powerful. Just like your tanks in the game your crew has a set of skills which progresses as you move through the different tiers in the game.

You can own multiple tanks but can only pilot 1 tank in any one game. Depending on what nation you choose will determine what research tree you will advance through to unlock new, more powerful tanks, weapons, and crew members to help your battles against the other enemy tanks. Since World of Tanks initial release there have been numerous updates to improve the difficulty, the visual aspects, new fresh maps, and new tanks and allow more exciting clan features of the game.

However, what once was came to an end when the king of the gods, Zeus, sought to prevent the prophesied  fall of the gods by opening Pandora’s Box. Upon doing so, he unwittingly corrupted himself and became a slave to demons, causing the world to fall into disarray. Humans and gods all suffered.

The only solution now is for someone pure to bring the holy angels together and save the world.

6,Blade and Soul,https://www.freetogame.com/g/6/thumbnail.jpg,Live,A free-to-play martial arts MMORPG that tasks players with learning combination attacks.,"Blade & Soul is a free-to-play, action combat MMORPG from NCSoft that initially released in 2012 in Korea but finally saw a Western release in January 2016. Blade & Soul is a martial arts inspired MMORPG that tasks players with learning action combat based combination attacks for each class. Currently, there are 7 classes available in the game; Assassin, Blade Master, Destroyer, Force Master, Kung-Fu Master, Summoner, and Blade Dancer. New players will want to research the classes prior to starting a new character since classes fall under various race restrictions when choosing from one of the game’s four currently available races.

Blade & Soul’s most notable feature is perhaps the game’s combat. Skills are learned as you level up and are displayed on hotbars in the traditional MMORPG style, but the actual implementation of those skills differs from most other games in the genre. While you will work with “rotations” in combat, it is perhaps better to think of these rotations in the form of “combinations” as each class will have a plethora of skills that can be combined in succession to perform very well animated combination attacks. These combinations may only be two or three buttons or they could be MUCH longer. Unlike other action combat MMOs though, Blade & Soul isn’t going to spoon feed you the combinations by hitting one key to trigger the next strike in the combination. Instead, Blade & Soul requires you to actually learn not only the combination itself, but each ability’s timing, and the required position to execute certain parts of the combination (Your hot bar actually can change based on position. i.e. being knocked down may give you access to abilities that cannot be used while standing). Learning these combination, aiming them appropriately, and reacting to incoming attacks are the key to the game’s fast paced and sometimes complex combat. If you liked TERA’s combat, you’ll probably enjoy Blade & Soul’s quite a bit.

Leveling brings the usual grind of story, side, and repeatable quests but the game’s environments change so often and are very well rendered that you won’t get bored by the scenery for quite some time. Transportaion is handled with sprint, glide, and even water walking abilities to speed up any backtracking you may have do. Instant teleports are available by spending in-game currency. Leveling requires completion of quests and along the way players will gain gear that can be upgraded along with your character. Feed equipment that you don’t need to your sword, for example, and you get a sword that levels up as your character does. This primary upgrading mechanic applies to many different gear pieces and keeps players going after loot simply to “feed” their primary equipment.

The addition of a “Soul Shield” allows for extra stat customization provided you can find the pieces of the shield you desire. Skills can be further customized at about level 18 (it’s actually a story completion point that triggers this mechanic) by spending points in your martial tome to increase ability effectiveness.

If you enjoy dungeons, Blade & Soul has quite a few options for you. Each dungeon (be it a full instance or just a cave on the world map) has numerous difficulty levels and varying party size requirements. This keeps the loot fest rolling as certain dungeons will drop the items needed to “Breakthrough” on your weapon and gear upgrading. The game’s matchmaking system makes finding a party for these runs very easy.

Blade & Soul’s PvP is based on two main categories; World PvP and Arena PvP. Arena PvP is a 1v1 or 3v3/6v6 (currently only in Korea) affair. Versus matches are simply queued for while World PvP is based on what your character is wearing. You read that right. World PvP is based on what you are wearing. It’s a creative way to “flag” for PvP. Simply donning the costume of one of the game’s 2 factions makes you able to be attacked by a member of the opposing faction out in the world. Other costumes could turn normally friendly NPCs into enemy NPCs that will attack you on sight.

Blade & Soul’s cash shop varies by geographic location but for the most part contains the normal consumables, costumes, and cosmetics. However, some materials are also available in the shop. The multiple shops actually utilize multiple currency types and a currency exchange system is in place to provide free players with a means to acquire cash shop items. A subscription service is also available and provides additional perks to players that opt for the payment.",https://www.freetogame.com/open/blade-and-soul,MMORPG,Windows,NCSoft,NCSoft,2016-01-19,Windows XP,Intel Core 2 DUo E6600 2.4 GHz / AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 4600+,2 GB,GeForce 8600 GT / ATI Radeon HD 4650,15GB

Matches end after a time limit, or when a sufficient number of kills have been reached.

3,Warframe,https://www.freetogame.com/g/3/thumbnail.jpg,Live,A cooperative free-to-play third person online action shooter set in an stunning sci-fi world. ,"Warframe is a 3D free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter game set in an stunning sci-fi world. In the distant future, war against the Grineer Empire leads humanity to summon ancient warriors from the distant past. Called “Tenno,” these agile fighters are equally skilled in blades and guns, able to carve their way through scores of enemies with skill and aplomb. A vast arsenal of these human weapons are called upon in mankind’s darkest hour to rescue their brethren from total annihilation.

As one of these Tenno, staked with protecting humanity, you’ll root out the Grineer from all their hiding places, scouring the Solar System and eliminating this nefarious threat. You’ll choose from among dozens of deadly Warframes, each with its own set of skills and strengths. The game progresses through a series of levels, each themed around a planet or region of the Solar System, and each requiring a squad of four Tenno to clear. As you advance, you’ll unlock more power for your Tenno, including new weapons and skills, letting you take on even tougher enemies.

Tenno have a number of sweet moves at their disposal, including the ability to “parkour” over and around obstacles, ziplines they can balance on, wall-latching and wall-dashing, and more. Tenno are also spiritual warriors, able to channel energy to spectacular results, including augmenting their weapon damage or activating special powers. Even when downed in battle, Tenno can continue to fight and rally to continue their missions.

Between missions, you can purchase better weapons for your Tenno or even entirely new Warframes, so you can try out a different play style. Some items cost credits (in-game currency) while others require platinum, which is purchased with real money. You can also craft your own weapons and insert mods to make them more powerful. Your ship, the Liset, is also where you’ll select your next mission, which you can choose to be public, letting anyone join you, or private, which you can attempt with a pre-selected team.

Warframe requires fast reflexes and split-second timing to execute a Tenno’s most dynamic moves. Because the game demands constant progression, and the resources required to purchase those progressions, a high skill factor is required, not only to play, but to play quickly enough to advance at a reasonable rate – and to keep up with your teammates. As such, there’s a lot of repetition required. If you want to quickly rip through content over and over, growing in power with each iteration, Warframe will suit you.",https://www.freetogame.com/open/warframe,Shooter,Windows,Digital Extremes,Digital Extremes,2013-03-25,Windows XP SP 3 or higher ,Intel Core 2 Duo e6400 or AMD Athlon x64 4000+ ,2 GB RAM ,Nvidia GeForce 8600 GT or ATI Radeon HD 3600 ,10 GB HD space 
13,Guild Wars 2,https://www.freetogame.com/g/13/thumbnail.jpg,Live,"A free-to-play MMORPG, the follow-up to ArenaNet's popular Guild Wars. ","Guild Wars 2 is a free-to-play open-world MMORPG, the follow-up to ArenaNet’s popular Guild Wars. Building on that first game’s guiding principles, it offers a huge world to explore, populated with dynamic events that can start at any time and provide excellent variety in gameplay. It also features PvP, both open-world and instanced, dungeons, raiding, storytelling, and everything else you’d expect in a full-featured massively multiplayer online RPG.

You’ll choose from among the five races of Tyria – human, norn, charr, sylvari, and asura – and one of several classes. Each class has remarkable versatility, allowing it to fill a number of roles in a party and reducing the need for a full MMO-style “trinity.” Characters have limited skill bars of 10 slots; the first five are determined by your weapon and the second five by skills that you choose: a healing skill, three utility skills, and an elite skill. Different classes have ways to access other skills, and most classes have the ability to swap out weapons, so you’ll still have some variety in exactly what tools you can bring to each fight.

The heart of Guild Wars 2 is its open-world content. While there is some static content, in the form of “hearts” that you can complete once for NPCs, most of the game revolves around dynamic events, which spring up in the world at various times and often require large groups of players to complete. There are no traditional quests that require you to speak to NPCs to accept or complete them; instead, you can simply go from event to event, helping the people of Tyria as you see fit. Some events are parts of larger chains that string together and culminate in a giant event against a great threat to Tyria and require a hundred or more players to complete.",https://www.freetogame.com/open/guild-wars-2,MMORPG,Windows,NCsoft,ArenaNet,2012-08-28,Windows® XP Service Pack 3 or better,"Intel® Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHz, Core i3 OR AMD Athlon 64 X2, or better",2 GB RAM,"NVIDIA® GeForce® 7800, ATI X1800, Intel HD 3000, or better (256 MB of video RAM and shader model 3.0 or better)",35 GB available HDD space

Developed by Jagex, the game does not require players to choose a specific class. Subsequently, you are not limited in terms of what kind of hero you want to play. The browser MMORPG features 26 distinct skills for players to level. Players do not allocate points to upgrade certain skills. Rather, their abilities are enhanced by performing certain actions like mining ore, casting spells of fishing.

The world of Gelinor is divided into various kingdoms, regions and cities. Each regions features different loot, monsters and quests to complete. You explore this vast world via a customizable avatar. The game allows you to interact with other players in various different ways including the in-game chat system, combat and mini-games that are either competitive or collaborative.

Players will be tasked with building their own settlement and watching it flourish. This settlement advancement follows paths similar to other Strongholds titles in that players will research advancement paths of their choosing to open up new build options and new technologies.

Stronghold Kingdoms adds in a card mechanic that allows players to use cards as modifiers when building, trading, and attacking or defending their own Stronghold. As in previous titles though, diplomacy is a key aspect of success in Strongholds Kingdoms. Trading, negotiating, and working with thousands of other players through the game’s world is the key to taking over land and working your way up to a leadership role. Be careful though as working against the wrong alliance could spell the end to all of your hard work very quickly.

Stronghold Kingdoms gathered early praise when it launched in 2012, but recent player reviews lean more towards the game becoming more pay to win than most players would like. With well-established alliances in game already, starting out can be hard for new players looking to try out the game for a bit prior to spending real life money. A certain amount of “join us or die” mentality seems to pervade player reviews and new players may log in to find everything they’ve been working for gone rather quickly.

What if it were basically Rocket League but on a track instead of a field, and wearing skates instead of driving a car. Well, if that’s what you’re looking for, Ubisoft’s latest offer, Roller Champions, is one you’ll want to check out.

A 3v3 competitive game, Roller Champions is played in third-person. It pits two teams against each other in matches where the goal is to be the first team to accumulate 5 points. The catch is that players only have seven minutes to accomplish this task. In order to do so they’ll need to have possession of the ball and skate a lap without interferrence from the other side. If that’s accomplished players can pass the ball off to other team mates who may complete even more laps. The more laps a team completes, the more points they’ll earn when they score a goal. Be careful deciding when to hit the goal, though, everything resets if the other side manages to interrupt.

Interrupting is pretty much what you probably think it is. If a team has the ball, it’s the job of the other side to tackle them or knock them over – pretty much whatever gains them possession of the ball. That said, these things can be dodged. So just be aware of your surroundings.

If you win matches, you’ll gain followers. More followers are accumulated every time a match is won. These allow teams to play in front of larger crowds. In addition, as with most games in this genre, players can customize their avatars’ gear. But, beyond that, they can customize their fans as well. That means players can look in the crowd and see just how many people are there for them.

The game offers players a sizeable collection of heroes to choose from before building their deck. Each of the heroes is tied to one of four factions – each represented by different colors, as are the rest of the cards. Since the game has a heavy focus on lore, that focus is worked into the gameplay system. Chroma matches are three-act stories, with progression in those acts introducing better ways for players to use their abilities. Of course, this requires players to  mange everything properly in order to tell a successful story.

Unlike other card games, Chroma does not charge players for card packs. Every card and game mode are available to players the minute they download the game and the developers promise this will always be the case. Instead, Clarity Games has monitized the game using cosmetics. This includes card art, loading screens, taunts, and more.

Equip your ‘mech with the latest weapons and gear and take to the battlefield to turn your opponents into scrap metal!

After selecting your faction, your most important task as an aspiring ‘mech pilot is to choose the chassis of your ‘mech. From light scouts to heavy assault ‘mechs, each ‘mech has its own specialty and role on the battlefield. Some are better at close-quarters fighting, while other excel at long range or quick-hitting attacks, unable to sustain long-term encounters. Once you’ve chosen a ‘mech chassis, it’s time to kit it out. The weight of equipment and its power consumption are factors you must balance to ensure that your ‘mech can continue to move and fight in long battles.

There are several match types: Conquest (victory points), Assault (capture the base), Skirmish (deathmatch), and Invasion (attack/defend), which can be contested on one of over a dozen maps. In addition to one-off matches, MechWarrior Online has Faction Play, which pits the various factions against each other for control of the Inner Sphere.

As you complete matches, you’ll earn C-bills, which you can use to buy more equipment for your ‘mech, or entirely new ‘mechs. Some equipment can only be purchased with ‘mech credits, which are awarded in smaller amounts in certain matches or bought with real money. Finally, the ‘mechs themselves earn ‘mech XP, which can be used to unlock additional capabilities and skills for the ‘mechs. There are many ways to play MechWarrior Online, so the key is finding the strategies and equipment that work the best for you.",https://www.freetogame.com/open/mechwarrior-online,Shooter,Windows,Piranha Games Inc.,Piranha Games Inc.,2015-12-10,Windows Vista ,Intel: Core 2 Duo E7300 @ 2.66 GHz / AMD: Athlon 64 X2 6400+ @ 3.2GHz ,2 GB RAM ,NVIDIA: 8800 GT / AMD: Radeon HD 5670,16 GB available space

While the city of Providence is a safe zone (allowing players to meet up, trade, buy items, and not have to worry about death, everything beyond its borders is wilderness that can be fully developed by players who can alter the game’s landscape permanently. Your specific character doesn’t have a pore-define role, either. Become what you want to become by mastering a plethora of skills and trades. Build things, combat threats, or hell, even dabble in a bit of Alchemy or Goat Rearing (yes, that’s a viable skill.)

Be careful though, outside the walls of Providence, anything goes. Since Salem features a permadeath mechanic, players will want to take their time before venturing too far. Skilling up a bit, discovering a few things you can make or build, and generally making some friends might be a huge boost to players right off the bat.

Salem’s art style is a bit unique and certainly won’t appeal to everyone. For the most part, the game adopts an isometric viewpoint similar to ARPGs like Path of Exile. The graphics themselves are quite simple and straight forward, even if they don’t tip the scales of realism in any way.

With innumerable materials, crafting combinations, and the challenge of in-game death ever-present, Salem offers a unique contribution to the sandbox MMORPG genre. Salem is developed by Mortal Moments and published by Paradox Interactive

Set in a post-apocalyptic London, Dirty Bomb boasts a “higher skill ceiling” than other free-to-play shooters in that controllers are not natively supported and no auto aim or aim assist system is used forcing players to develop faster reactions and strategies through gameplay.

Dirty Bomb’s classes work in the form of “Mercs,” mercenaries that have various skill sets that range from being able to drop turrets to calling in orbital laser strikes. Players are allowed to select multiple Mercs before a match and swap between them between deaths as needed. Currently there are three primary gameplay modes in Dirty Bomb. Objective mode challenges both team to meet various objectives on the map and the match timer has time added as each objective is met. Stopwatch mode is a variation on Objective mode except this time, each team is given a chance to both attack and then defend the objectives. The fastest time overall wins. Finally, Execution mode. This mode is straight forward: Eliminate the opposing team or blow up the objective.

Dirty Bomb’s 5 maps can support up to 8v8 gameplay and the 18 available Mercs (as of this writing) offer a fair amount of diversity, speed, abilities, and usefulness in the game. The game also features the use of a card system to augment Merc loadouts. New players will want to search out a guide for their Merc of choice as this system, while explained, does require a bit of guidance.

Dirty Bomb’s system specs are a tad higher since the game environment is nicely detailed and player reports indicate that game performance may suffer on lower end machines.",https://www.freetogame.com/open/dirty-bomb,Shooter,Windows,"

Each level consists of a piece of cheese and a hole to serve as a start and end point. Players have two minutes to get to the cheese and get back to the hole, jockeying for position with other mice along the way. In addition to pits, ledges, and other difficult-to-reach places, some levels include elements with physics-based properties, such as bridges that wobble and snap if too many mice are on it.

One mouse on each level is the shaman, who has mystical powers that allow him to place elements in the world to (theoretically) help all mice reach the cheese. He can bridge gaps or build ramps to help, and the more mice who reach the cheese on his watch, the faster he progresses up the shaman skill tree to learn even more impressive talents. But a poor shaman can also just get in the way, “accidentally” blocking off areas and leading mice to their doom.

With seven game modes, hundreds of official maps, and millions of player-created maps, no two rounds of Transformice are ever exactly the same. The cash shop consists of only one type of item – hats – which have no gameplay benefits and can be earned in-game, though be warned: Some are incredibly difficult to obtain!

ArcheAge offers four unique races which possess their own innate qualities with an additional ten skill trees that create up to one hundred and twenty class options.

There are 7 different levels of mastery for each profession and each level grants a crafting benefit of some sort to the player.

ArcheAge features both PvE and PvP options. PvE choices include the typical dungeons and quests, while PvP offers features such as the Justice System, Arenas, Naval Battles and World PvP. Community options go beyond what is typical for an MMORPG, and while guilds are a part of the community, there are also factions and families.

Trion Worlds’ flagship MMORPG, Rift, started as a subscription based MMORPG and later made a free-to-play conversion in June of 2013. MMORPG players probably remember Rift’s aggressive advertising campaign leading up to its 2011 release. This campaign specifically touted Telara, the game’s world, as the new place for players to be and poked fun at chief rival World of Warcraft with slogans like “You’re not in Azeroth anymore” in most print and media advertisements.

Character creation in Rift allows players to choose their race (limited by faction) and a starting archetype (calling) for your playstyle. The five callings currently available are Primalist, Warrior, Mage, Cleric, and Rogue. Players have ample room for customizations inside these callings though as each calling has a multitude of “souls” (what would be more traditionally referred to as “classes”) that allow players to mix and match abilities within each calling to customize their character’s abilities. This mixing and matching of multiple souls allows hundreds of playstyle combinations, some more viable than others. Some souls are only available through purchases of cash shop packages.

Rift features two faction gameplay between The Defiant and The Guardians, although updates since launch have blurred the lines between factions by allowing factions to group together, chat, and even guild together. Factions still play a role in Rift’s PvP Warfronts. This PvP content features multiple maps and gameplay types that focus on point accumulation or point capturing. Open world PvP is also supported provided you are playing on a PvP server.

Players looking for PvE content will find that Rift offers a vast world to explore, dungeons (solo, duo and party varieties), raids, in world events such as the “Rifts” for which the game is named, and an extensive storyline detailing the elemental planes and how they interconnect and impact the world of Telara. “Instant Adventures” allow players to group quickly, and level rather quickly, through quick bursts of open world content. Traditional questing is also a leveling option.

Numerous subsystems provide Rift players with ample activities in which to partake. Player housing is accomplished through a “Dimensions” system that allows players to unlock multiple area types and decorate them as they see fit. This system has been expanded to also allow players to create their own PvP Dimensions and bring their own PvP maps to life. The Minion mini-game, crafting, collectibles, and achievement hunting are big parts of the Rift community and numerous sites cater to each of these items alone.

While equipment is available in Rift’s cash shop, this equipment is “one off or worse” than the current best equipment available in the game. To achieve the best gear, players will have to play the game and cannot buy their way to max power. Most of this gear is also available through in game currency gathering as well. The cash shop is designed in a “time versus money” approach with players being able to spend either the in game time or the cash to advance quickly, but either method ends with players having to play to achieve the best in slot items. Patron (subscription) status is available for those that want to earn Loyalty points (a cash shop “rewards” program) and receive monthly perks allowing for more rapid character advancement. Players wishing to buy cash shop items without spending real world money have the option of purchasing “REX” in game from other players. REX can be used to obtain credits that can be spent in the cash shop.

229,Dota 2,https://www.freetogame.com/g/229/thumbnail.jpg,Live,Valve's premiere competitive free to play MOBA.,"Dota 2 is Valve’s premiere competitive free-to-play MOBA, the follow-up to the game that started the MOBA genre, Defense of the Ancients. Launched in 2013 to provide an alternative to Riot Games’ League of Legends, Dota 2 cranks up the strategy dial, requiring mastery of one’s hero and exemplary communication between all team members in a game that consistently ranks as one of the best MOBAs in the world.

Two opposing teams of five players select from over a hundred heroes, each with their own unique abilities, to fill out their teams. They travel down three lanes, each guarded by a series of defensive towers and patrolled by AI enemies that are friendly to one of the teams and spawn continuously. The space between lanes, the “jungle,” is occupied by neutral enemies that either team can kill to obtain bonuses. The object of the game is to push through the opponents’ defenses all the way to their base, where their Ancient resides, and destroy it.

Heroes come in a wide variety of flavors, with many different talents and roles. They increase in power as their team kills AI enemies and other players, accumulating XP to level up and gold that can be used to purchase items at their base. Making the proper purchases for your role is an essential piece of strategy, to the point that having the correct “build” is a major part of your strategy.

Thanks in part to its visibility on Valve’s Steam platform, Dota 2 also has a very active professional competitive e-sports scene, with local, regional, national, and worldwide tournaments that offer millions of dollars in prizes. A documentary, titled Free to Play, was released in 2014, and it’s an example of how serious Valve is about bringing e-sports into the mainstream, using its games to tell a story and presenting them as a viable viewing option on par with major professional sports.",https://www.freetogame.com/open/dota-2,MOBA,Windows,Valve,Valve,2013-07-09,Windows 7 ,Dual core from Intel or AMD at 2.8 GHz ,4 GB RAM ,"nVidia GeForce 8600/9600GT, ATI/AMD Radeon HD2600/3600", 8 GB available space

Unlike games such as League of Legends which uses an isometric perspective, the player is controlled using a third person view. The landscape is remarkable incredible from snowy and cold environments, to volcanoes. Which are all rendered with the lovely CryEngine 3 game engine. The maps are handled nicely since when you start a new game the map will be chosen randomly.  A unique aspect for each map are the secrets in the map which a player can use to change the map for the players advantage.

Attacking enemy players in Panzar is based on a free-targeting type of game. Damaging enemy players is entirely based on the angle of attack. The controls for the game use the mouse in order to strike attacks. The left mouse button is used for auto-attacks, and the right mouse button is used for massive power attacks which drains your power. Power in the game is indicated by a power bar, which can be restored using abilities to the player, or by just simply waiting for the power bar to fill.

After each match, players are awarded credits and experience and can use both to upgrade and research every aspect of their fleet from weapons to actual space craft. After researching and upgrading, players can swap out parts on their spacecraft adding more armor to lighter attack ships, more firepower to smaller ships, or generally customize their favorite ship to be a freak of space nature on the battlefield.

While Star Conflict is primarily a team based PvP game, players do have the option of taking on quests (also available in PvP play as secondary objectives) and some PvE content geared towards both group and solo play. Since players will be joining one of three factions at the start of their space career, each faction has different objectives based on their faction’s needs. Certain spacecraft are even faction specific.

With detailed environments, a deep progression system, a multitude of spacecraft to choose from, and a cash shop similar to War Thunder’s, Star Conflict provides players with a top notch space combat simulator and encourages players to form up into alliances and create corporations that can control sections of the galaxy through combat domination.

232,Age of Wushu,https://www.freetogame.com/g/232/thumbnail.jpg,Live,A free-to-play martial arts action MMORPG with a large open world and sandbox-like features.,"Age of Wushu by Snail Games (“Age of Wulin by Webzen” in other global regions) is a free-to-play Wuxia inspired MMORPG that focuses on delivering a large open world while offering sandbox-like features. New players will take the role of an aspiring martial arts expert and will choose one of 8 schools. The school you choose will alter what skills your character will learn (and become more proficient at) over time and learning these skill “books” is the game’s primary advancement technique as Age of Wushu eschews the traditional “leveling” mechanics found in other MMOs. Your chosen school also determines the weapon type your character will use.

Age of Wushu has been developed using a proprietary engine called “FLEXI.” This engine allows the game to maintain a higher graphical performance and makes updates to technology easier to implement in game by simply adding new modules to the engine rather than upgrading the entire engine itself.

Combat in Age of Wushu is a bit different than other MMORPGs. Combat takes on a more “rock-paper-scissors” mentality. Skills are categorized as “Overt” damage skills, “Feint” defense-breaking skills, and “Block” defensive skills. There are secondary “Chi” (energy) draining skills outside of these three categories but combat primarily revolves around using the right skill type at the right type to react to PvE and PvP threats. Movement skills, including gliding, jumping, and water walking, make the game’s combat reminiscent of martial arts movie action scenes.

While Age of Wushu features traditional MMORPG features like questing, PvP, an in game marketplace, and a story that’s been expanded through multiple game expansions, the game is maybe most well-known for some of its more unique features. The “Offline Mode” allows players to advance their characters in some ways while not actually playing the game. Assigning your character duties in shops, school, or other locations while you are offline can net your character benefits when you return to the game. The other side of that feature, though, allows players in game to kidnap offline players for gains of their own. In game, players can also use systems like the “Criminal System” to place bounties on other players.

Age of Wushu brings some unique items to the MMO game space but may not be a hit with all players. It is certainly a game that benefits from playing for free for a bit prior to spending money on something that may not be your “cup of tea.”",https://www.freetogame.com/open/age-of-wushu,MMORPG,Windows,Snail Games,Snail Games,2012-12-20,Windows XP,Intel Pentium 4 2.4 Ghz or equivalent,1 GB,GeForce 6600 GT or equivalent,10 GB

Although the game is Free to Play, in order to play certain Chapters, you must purchase them with “Crowns”, which is the in-game premium currency for Pirate 101. There is also a membership plan that allows the user to have limited-time access to every chapter in the game, during their timed subscription.

Some of the major ways Pirate 101 maintains its kid-friendly atmosphere is by limited player interaction, and having parental controls set in place. There are three different chat modes in Pirate 101, each with a different level of restrictions. Another interesting tidbit; Pirate 101 takes place in the same universe as Wizard 101, which is also known for its family-friendly style of gameplay.

Players travel through Spiral on a Flying Pirate ship which can be completely customized, from the cannons you use all the way down to the anchor. There are over 50 different companions in the game, which you can use in combat to provide you with the edge you need in order to defeat your foes.

As you progress through the game and earn more resources, you can expand your island with several different structures like rum distilleries. These distilleries are paramount in progressing through the game, rum being of obvious importance to pirates. To get resources, players can either create their own, or raid other players for their booty. Additionally, flotsam (pieces from a shipwreck) can be collected from around the shores of players’ islands, which can contain every available resource in the game. This serves as a nice means of burning time while players wait to finish researching technologies or completing new structures.

From the world map, players can see shipwrecks to salvage and other islands to pillage. Some will make for easy prey, but landlubbers beware: some will be defended by captains from neighboring islands. Troops, which are needed to attack other players, can be obtained from the tavern once it’s built. Players with the necessary resource like gold and rum can deploy their pirate fleet comprising both offensive and defensive troops. They each serve a distinct purpose, and certain missions will call for one or the other.

Once a player has attacked another player, they will appear on each other’s “enemy list.” Players can attack people on their list as much as they please, provided they have the resources. Players can also attack certain points held by other players such as stashes of gems or gold. Each point has an expiration date that ticks ever closer while it is occupied. Additionally, if a player is part of an alliance, they can deploy troops to protect points held by their friends to ensure it is not successfully plundered before the timer runs out.

Star Wars: The Old Republic allows players to become one of several different iconic classes including Jedi, Sith, and Troopers, with a variety of species to choose from. Each class follows their own unique custom storyline which contains a number of dynamic questions allowing players to become immersed in their character’s progression and ultimately choose their own destiny.

Players choose to join either the Galactic Republic or the Sith Empire. The game is set more than 3,500 years prior to the films and allows players to visit and interact with some classic environments such as the planets Tatooine and Coruscant. While each class may favor a certain playstyle (tank, DPS, or healer) customization options along with companion characters allow the individual player to adapt to a number of situations without relying on the support of other players. Character appearance customization is limited to a few slide bar choices but further options are available through the cash shop with the use of Cartel Coins.

Character leveling and progression is done through the standard missions, exploration, and defeating enemies. New skills are learned at each level and are taught by trainers in a number of locations. There are heroic missions that require the cooperation of other players and can typically be repeated on a daily basis. Leveling has been vastly accelerated to encourage players to jump into the game’s more recent expansions.

One of the more unique features about Star Wars: The Old Republic is that the dynamic choices players make can permanently open or close parts of the story line and can affect the player’s NPC companions and any relationships you may have with those companions.

Crafting in Star Wars: The Old Republic is a much more passive activity than the typical MMORPG, NPC companions carry out the gathering and crafting activates as assigned by the player while the player is participating in active adventures. A player can assign up to 5 companions to perform 3 different skills.

The multiplayer co-op game play has been likened more to a survival horror game than a typical first person shooter, but the game relies on typical first person mechanics.

Fight your way with friends through multiple mission types and objectives while trying to avoid becoming infected by zombies yourself. Should you become infected, do you warn your teammates or keep quiet and hope your situation improves? The choice is yours. Speaking up could earn you a quick death at the hands of your own teammates.

Players are able to modify their server rules and can make the game more realistic by not using typical gameplay features like a HUD or even crosshairs. Even voice chat and text chat is limited by distance so keep your friends close. While some servers opt for unlimited ammo, the traditional gameplay keeps things dire by providing very little ammo and a sense of dread as zombies of different varieties close on your location. Some are fast, some may be slow, and in the end, it may not be a zombie that is the most dangerous to you.

Being a mod, No More Room in Hell is constantly being added to and improved and many more features are slated to be released this year to improve the look, feel, and addictiveness of the game.

In Dragon Nest, players select from a number of pre-created heroes that have various skill sets (specializing in magic, ranged, melee, etc) and play through a series of instance based “dungeons” to level, learn new skills, and gain fame and fortune. What the game lacks in character creation options (you really only customize color and clothing) the game makes up for in its more action and arcade style combat. Players will be challenged in combat (you can adjust difficulty) and will require lightning fast reactions and intelligent use of skill combinations to take down their foes…even other players. This makes combat (and PvP) more of a skill based encounter where skill can trump character level.

Dragon Nest is well known for its epic boss battles. Expect to see big monsters and creatures that will challenge the way players approach each fight. Aim true, if you don’t you’ll spend a lot of time missing.

Stunning visuals and smooth animations will keep players visually enthralled while they rack up kill after kill in the game’s constantly changing dungeons.

Players can also take on pets and customize them.

On the payment side of things, Allods Online has gone through its own trials over the years. A few missteps with high cash shop prices, a brutally penalizing death mechanic, and a few items of questionable offering all led to a rather large player base backlash.

PvP comes in multiple forms staring at 1v1 and extending to group based brawls where the fast based combo action flashes all over your screen.

While Elsword doesn’t feature much in the way of character creation since you are choosing from a list of predefined heroes, you are able to customize your character a bit on the looks front and after leveling a bit (to level 15) you can specialize the skill set your character uses into one of multiple skill trees. Some characters are even combinations of more than one character with the player choosing which character to control in a given situation.

Each character has its own unique backstory, motivations, and storyline so playing through multiple characters is certainly something many players do each time a new character is introduced.

Start your adventure by creating your very own superhero or villain, complete with various superpowers, and then team up with iconic DC Comic characters like Batman, The Joker, and others to complete your “training” as a new resident of this hero infested world.

While DCUO sports many traditional MMORPG systems, the game also has a more unique interface specifically designed for an MMO that spans both PC and console platforms, and one that lends itself very well to controller play.

PvE content is explored primarily through the use of story episodes, raids, Duo instances, and Iconic Battles. Following the game’s DLC story additions, DCUO allows players to fly, sprint, and brawl their way through memorable locations such as Gotham City, Metropolis, and others all while assisting well known DC Universe characters throughout the DLC story. DCUO is a free-to-play title, but additional DLC does come at a cost for those that do not opt for the monthly subscription fee. These additional content items (episodes) can be purchased individually as can additional character slots and other in-game items.

On the PvP side of content, DCUO provides two primary PvP options: Arenas and Legends. Matches come in the 1v1, 2v2, 4v4, 5v5, and 8v8 variety. Legends PvP allows players to assume the role of pre-balanced iconic DC characters regardless of the player’s actual character level or faction affiliation. This mode is a nice way for players to farm PvP currency without having to wait until they level but some heroes and villains are locked and require either a cash purchase or unlocking with PvP currency. Arenas are the more standard PvP option allowing players to take their individual characters into the fray. Open world PvP is available provided that the player has entered a PvP server.

That was one thousand years ago; the Five Heroes defeated Elga in battle and imprisoned him in the labyrinth of the Shadow Cabinet. But the victory brought about by the Five Heroes doesn’t last.

This prequel to Mabinogi takes place several hundred years before the story of Mabinogi. In Korea, the game is known as Mabinogi Heroes, though the name was changed for North American and European audiences.

In the beginning of Vindictus, humans are convinced that if they can destroy Fomors, or monstrous humanoids, they will essentially be taken into their version of Heaven, known as Erinn. Players battle through hordes of enemies either alone, with friends, or sometimes with strangers, to take out these creatures. Vindictus is broken up into “Seasons” and with each season, the story changes and brings a whole new level of exploration and understanding.

The game centers around an intense combat style that teaches you to avoid getting hit or die. Fighting Combos are also valued far more than a general face-roll concept many MMOs have found themselves taking on. The ten classes of the game are all gender-locked, as you are portraying a particular character rather than just a class, but some customization of the characters is allowed, including coloring or cutting their hair. The dungeons have dynamic difficulty with the health of the bosses scaling to the number of people in the party.

Vindictus holds true to Nexon’s business model and is free to download and play, while offering a “Cash Shop” for those willing to drop some money on the game. Filled with magicians, warriors, archers and thieves of all varieties, your choices will depend on your personal fighting preferences and your desired role within the game. All classes are intended to deal damage and be self-sufficient as they battle through a real-time combat system.

One of the key pieces of Ancient Greek history was the worship of the gods of Olympus. Grepolis takes that a step further by giving players access to Divine Powers based on which Greek god they choose to worship.

Grepolis also doesn’t limit players to Greek monuments. As players expand the borders of their ancient empires, they can construct the wonders of the Ancient world and place them wherever they want regardless of historic accuracy.

Oh well… if you showed up here I should at least give you the basics. League of Legends is a free-to-play competitive MOBA game, and one of the most played video game in the world, developed by Riot Games.

Players are tasked with teaming up with other players and squaring off against another team of players, typically in 5v5 matches. Three lanes connect a team’s base (or Nexus) to the other team’s base. Defensive measures for both teams also reside in each lane. Players choose a hero from over 120 Champions. Each character has its own skill set and abilities that help it excel in certain areas of the game. The key to winning matches is teamwork and solid reactions to enemy abilities. A strong understanding of the item meta game and what helps each particular champion is certainly desirable.

Push each lane and try to take out your opponent’s defensive turrets (and their ever spawning creeps – small NPC minions that blindly move forward on each lane) and enemy champions on your way to taking out the enemy Nexus and scoring yourself a win.

Along the way, your champion will gain experience and gold and level up their abilities and allow you to purchase game items to modify your champion’s stats and performance.

These battles take place in two different game modes across a total of 4 available maps…although you’re probably only going to ever see one map unless you play in games against AI bot opponents.

In addition to in-game leveling and ranked matches each season, players also have modifiers on their profile through the use of Rune Pages. These pages allow players to “socket” Glyphs, Marks, Seals, and Quintessences to modify stats for you as the player. These modifications are then placed on any Champion you choose to play.

Matchmaking in League of Legends is based primarily on your skill and past match performances. The automated system attempts to match competitors up with players of a similar skill level so as to avoid blowout matches.

League of Legends is often held up as the quintessential free-to-play model in that no aspect of gameplay (besides arguably additional rune pages even though they are not essential) is locked behind a cash shop purchase. The cash shop houses skins, cosmetics, and Champions and currency to purchase these items can be bought with real world money or farmed in-game.",https://www.freetogame.com/open/league-of-legends,MOBA,Windows,Riot Games,Riot Games,2009-10-27,"Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8",2 GHz Modern processor,1 GB for Windows XP. 2 GB for everything else,Shadow 2.0 capable video card,8 GB

Developed by the Aion Team and published by a number of publishers worldwide (most notably NCSoft in the US and GameForge in the EU),

New players will choose a faction and then choose one of 6 classes (Warrior, Scout, Mage, Priest, Technist, and Muse) to start the game and will have the chance to further specialize this class upon “Ascending” when you reach level 10. This is also when players will receive the feature Aion may most well be known for, your wings. Using these wings, players can glide and swoop their way down onto foes in both PvE and PvP content.

Since its initial Western launch, Aion has undergone many changes to shed the stigma of the “grindy” game it was viewed as at launch. New content has been added to streamline leveling, a new “Fast Track” server where players can play at a faster experience rate was introduced, and early game content has been streamlined to push players into the newer updates and expansions faster.

PvE players will find a plethora of dungeons (solo, duo, and party varieties) to tackle and can look forward to late game raiding (note that “raids” in Aion are small party affairs) as well.

PvP and PvPvE was, perhaps, the most notable feature in the game when it launched as the flight aspect of PvP introduced a new take on player combat. PvPvE also pits both factions against each other in the Abyss while introducing monsters and NPC characters that both factions have to contend with at the same time. The Abyss also features points like castles that can be taken over by players as this zone is highly dynamic when on an active server.

While the game is free-to-play and does have some typical MMORPG elements (combat, questing, looting, etc) the primary difference between Entropia Universe and other games is the linking of a real world currency exchange.

Imagine this: you spend $10 USD to buy some in game currency. You then use that currency and your skills (like sweating monsters) to farm up items of value and triple your total in-game currency. Sounds familiar so far, right? Here’s where Entropia Universe differs though. You can exchange that in-game currency BACK into real world money whenever you want to do so at a fixed conversion rate. This means players can play their game, have some fun, and turn an actual real life profit if they work hard enough.

This primary economic mechanic had netted Entropia Universe some serious press as players buy and sell actual locations in game for hundreds of thousands of real life dollars. The game has also appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records earning titles multiple times for the most expensive virtual items ever sold.

In game, players aren’t really limited to classes. If you like combat, go for it. Want to be a surgeon? You can do that too.
